# PROJECT: AUTHENTICATION

Members only is an app that lets users write posts, much like a message board, and see what other users have posted. People who haven't signed up for an account at Members Only can still see all the posts on the site but can't see who authored which post.

This is a very basic web application that can do the following:

- Create new user accounts.
- Registered users can create text post.
- Displays all users' posts on the home page.
- Keeps unregistered users from knowing who authored wich post.
- Users can update their user information.
- Posts can only be created, but not destroyed nor edited.

Members only has been built using the following gems:

- bulma-rails v0.9.1 --> CSS Framework
- devise v4.7.3 --> Flexible authentication solution for Rails with Warden

Ruby and Rails versions:

- ruby v6.1.3
- rails v2.7.2
